# Intro to SQL curriculum

Welcome to our SQL course. Our free set of pick up and play materials include: course timeline, course outline, a high quality set of teaching slides, teacher notes and engaging activities with premade Replit tasks and teacher solutions.

Learners will be introduced to the basics of SQL through a set of practical lessons that cover everything from creating a database, running simple and complex queries as well as how to use the like wildcard. Each lesson builds learner knowledge of SQL. We have made three levels of lessons with fun challenges along the way, allowing learners to apply the SQL knowledge theyâ€™ve learnt in previous lessons.

Feel free to use the curriculum as is, or modify it to fit your needs. If you share these materials (as is or with modifications), please provide attribution to Replit and Toni Scullion, who created the curriculum.
