# Free Curricula for Educators

At Replit, our mission is to make programming more accessible to all. We aim to do this by partnering with the incredibly talented educators in our community. Thanks to these partnerships, we can provide free curricula that educators are encouraged to use, modify, and share when they are teaching computer science and programming.

## **Why are we doing this?**

Our mission at Replit is to make programming more accessible to all. We know this can be accomplished through multiple avenues and in partnership with the inredibly talented educators in our community, which is why we are now providing free curricula that educators are free to use, modify, and share alike when they are teaching Computer Science and Programming.

Check this page regularly, as we aim to update it often with a wide variety of curricula across multiple disciplines.
