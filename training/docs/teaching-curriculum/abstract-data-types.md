# Abstract Data Types curriculum

## Course Overview

This course is designed for high school students with a moderate level of programming experience. It introduces how to construct abstract data types and how to use them to solve a variety of problems.

The language used throughout is Python, though the slides could be easily adapted to suit another language. If adapted, please provide attribution to Replit and Thomas Bach, who created it.
