# Intro to Python curriculum

This course is designed for students with little or no experience of programming and/or the Python language. It introduces core programming concepts and techniques used in the vast majority of programming languages.

Feel free to use the curriculum as is, or modify it to fit your needs. If you share these materials (as is or with modifications), please provide attribution to Replit and Andy Colley, who created the curriculum.

You can find more information and an in-depth overview [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DdYZkkyTZrcmFTtqmKYx6Rq4Sg_PbPNQT4_chUCZWfI/edit?usp=sharing).

## The Full Curriculum

This course is split into six sessions, each designed to take roughly 2-3 hours with a homework task as well.

For each session, there is a more in-depth .readme document to help you get started. This contains teacher notes to break down the key concepts linked to the coding skills, links to the tasks, and example solutions on Replit and the text of the tasks set. There’s also a slide deck for each week with presenter notes containing context, subject knowledge cues, possible questions to ask your students, and other useful links.

For every task, we’ve provided a hyperlink to a repl that students can work on. Share this with them and get them to fork their own version. We’ve also linked to an example solution. There are often multiple ways of completing a task, so students may well have different code that works (mine often do).

You can find a folder with all the lessons [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w1UZLD2sMQlEeFvOVmjUxk4WU8p0o8dJ?usp=sharing).

## Testimonials

> What you've put together is absolutely perfect. I appreciate that there is a video explaining the concepts, and the ppt is thorough. There are no useless workbooks for students to write in. But most of all, the tasks/replits are perfect for the students and they scaffold the concepts really well while still requiring some stand alone code.
