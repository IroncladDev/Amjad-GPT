# Replit web accessibility statement

_See our accessibility features [here](/programming-ide/workspace-features/preferences#accessibility)._

Replit believes that computing is for everyone. As such we are committed to making our service fully accessible to all, including people with disabilities. This statement explains our accessibility goals, our progress towards meeting those goals, and how you can contact us with feedback about accessibility on Replit.

# Conformance goals

Our aim is to achieve full compliance with the W3C WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Replit is currently partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of our website content do not yet fully conform to the accessibility standard.

# Current status

Replit has an ongoing internal project to improve our site’s accessibility, responding to our own internal evaluation, user interviews and reports, and the results of an independent evaluation conducted by the Cornell University IT Department in 2021.

The majority of content on our website is available in HTML format conformant with current W3C standards for HTML and CSS. Non-text content presented to the user, such as images and form elements, have a text alternative that can be recognized and spoken aloud by screen readers.

Despite our best efforts to ensure accessibility of Replit, you may encounter some limitations. In particular, the inability to fully manipulate the workspace using your keyboard is a known issue that we are working to address.

# Giving feedback

If you have any trouble accessing the Replit website, we encourage you to provide us with feedback by emailing [contact@replit.com](mailto:contact@replit.com). Please provide the URL (web address) of the material you tried to access, the problem you experienced, and your contact information.
