# Security

We understand that your code, applications, and user-data hosted on Replit are very important, so we
take seriously our responsibility to safeguard it. After all, we use Replit to build our business too!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Being a small startup with limited resources, we unfortunately can't run a bug bounty program. However, if you report a vulnerability responsibly, we'll work with you to fix the issue. We'll also credit you on our blog.

## Responsible Disclosure

Pursuant to our [terms of service](https://replit.com/site/terms), you should not take any actions
that interfere or disrupt the service. If you are in doubt, and think there might be a risk of service
disruption, then don't try to verify the bug yourself â€“ email us and we'll work with you to verify it.

Email [security@replit.com](mailto:security@replit.com) with a description of the issue and we'll respond as soon as possible.
