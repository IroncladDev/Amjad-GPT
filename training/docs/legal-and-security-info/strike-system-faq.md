# Strike system FAQ
Learn about warnings, banned community access, and site bans in Replit.

### What is a Warning in Replit?

A Moderator will send you a warning when you violate the [Community Standards](https://replit.com/@moderation/Welcome?c=244171), [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms), or [Privacy Policy](https://replit.com/site/privacy). Other disciplinary actions may include unpublishing of your Repl(s), cancellation of a Bounty, and/or hiding/deleting comments and Bounty Applications.

### Can I republish my Repl after it's been unpublished?

Yes. Revise your Repl to abide by the [Community Standards](https://replit.com/@moderation/Welcome), then republish.

### What happens when I'm banned from the Community?

When banned from the community, you cannot create posts, comments, share Repls, or participate in [Bounties](https://replit.com/bounties). However, you can still use the online IDE for features unrelated to community activity.

### What happens when I'm banned from Replit?

A ban from Replit means you cannot log into your account and all Repls will have been deleted. This often occurs for violating the [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms).

### How can I appeal a Moderation decision?

Contact the mods if you believe they took unfair action towards you. Send an email to [appeals@replit.com](mailto:appeals@replit.com) with your Replit username, a description of the action that you are appealing, and your reasons for the appeal.
