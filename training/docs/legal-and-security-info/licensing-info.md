# Licensing information

Here, you will find information about how your Repls are licensed.

## Public Repls and Teams

Content you create in a public Repl or in Teams for Friends is automatically subject to an MIT license. The full text of the MIT license reads as follows:

> Copyright

> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Specific Repl Licenses

Note that adding a license file to a public Repl does not prevent the Repl from being made available under the MIT license. To make a license file effective, the Repl must be made private as described below.

For specific Repls, we may offer features to allow users to change the default license. For example, we might enable the ability to earn or to pay in Cycles for rights in a Repl, or for access to specific features or digital items.

## Private Repls and Teams

Content in a private Repl and private Team is licensed to Replit on a platform basis under the [Terms of Service](https://replit.com/site/terms).

If you would like to attach your own license to the code, we recommend you include the license as a (code) comment or a readme.txt file, as part of the Repl.
