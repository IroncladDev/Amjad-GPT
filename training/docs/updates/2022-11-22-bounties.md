SHPNG SZN is still in full gear with new features, bug fixes and polish abound! (shameless plug for our [swag shop](https://shop.replit.com/collections/frontpage) where you can cop some SHPNG SZN gear)

In the last two weeks, we merged 762 pull requests, here are the highlights:

## Bounties

Last week, we officially launched Replit's first marketplace, [Bounties](https://replit.com/bounties)! Describe your task —> get software built by Replit's top creators. Check out [a case study](https://blog.replit.com/bounties-deel-case-study) on how Deel used Bounties to get an internal site built in just one week.

As a Replit community member, you can earn Cycles by completing Bounties. Learn more [here](/bounties/bounty-hunting).

Huge shout out to the Bounties team for their hard work on this project: Michael Hadley, Talor Anderson, Søren Rood, Aman Mathur, and Horacio Lopez.

## Status Manager

We just launched a Status Manager, where you can see all your running Repls: restart, kill, see logs, etc, it's awesome! Read more about it here on our [blog](https://blog.replit.com/repl-status), from its makers: Joe Thom and Lincoln Bergeson.

### CodeMirror

As our code editor runs on CodeMirror, we thought you should know about upstream fixes we've pulled down. Arnav recently upgraded us to all the latest CodeMirror packages, which came with the following notable changes:

- Fixed a bug that caused deletion commands on non-empty ranges to incorrectly return false and do nothing, causing the editor to fall back to native behavior
- CSS completion now supports a number of additional recent and semi-standardized pseudo-class names
- Deprecated HTML tags have been removed from completions
- Made JS `completionPath` handle `?.` syntax
- Added proper indentation handling of Python `else` clauses in `try` statements
- Work around a Chrome bug where it inserts a newline when you press space at the start of a wrapped line
- Align `rectangularSelection`'s behavior with other popular editors by making it create cursors at the end of lines that are too short to touch the rectangle
- Fixed an issue where coordinates on mark decoration boundaries were sometimes taken from the wrong side of the position
- Prevent scrolling artifacts caused by attempts to scroll stuff into view when the editor isn't being displayed
- Fixed a crash when trying to scroll something into view in an editor that wasn't in the visible DOM
- Fixed an issue where content on long wrapped lines could fail to properly scroll into view.
