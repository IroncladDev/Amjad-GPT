Welcome back to another edition of Replit Updates!

In the past two weeks we merged a total of 933 pull requests. Our top contributor this week is [Madison Fitch](https://replit.com/@motzyball) who landed 79 merged pull requests.

# New Git UI
[Brian Pool](https://replit.com/@brianpool) has been working tirelessly on improving the experience with Git and Replit.  If you've got [Explorer mode](https://replit.com/account#roles) enabled, you should see a new interface for interacting with Git.

You can now seamlessly commit, push, create pull requests on GitHub, and view Git History with this new feature.

# Tab Management
Clicking on a tab now allows you to copy the link to it, toggle folds, and switch to another file without opening up the file tree.

![Tab Dropdown](https://docimg.replit.com/updates/dropdown.png)

Clicking on the three dots in the top-right corner of a pane or hitting **CMD/CTRL+J** Opens another dropdown that allows you to manage tabs and panes without ever leaving your keyboard!

Try using **CMD+J** followed by **CMD+SHIFT+ARROWLEFT** or **CMD+ARROWLEFT** to move focus and navigate around the screen!

# Mobile Themes
Custom Themes are now available in the most recent version of the Replit mobile app!  Install the latest update on the App Store or the Google Play Store and you'll be able to manage and switch between your favorite Themes from the Account page.
