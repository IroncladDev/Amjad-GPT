Welcome back to another edition of the Replit Changelog!

In the past two weeks, we merged a total of 659 Pull Requests.

## Git Diffing

If your Repl is using the new [Git Integration](https://blog.replit.com/git-good), you will have access to Git Diffing which allows you to view the differences between your current code and the most recent code committed to your Repository's branch.

Aside from being able to view the diffs, you can edit your code directly even while Diff mode is activated.  To use this feature, select the **Diffing** button on the bottom of your code file.

## Ghostwriter Revamp

We recently released and open-sourced our new [`replit-code-v1-3b` AI model](https://huggingface.co/replit/replit-code-v1-3b), which is now powering Ghostwriter's Complete Code feature.  

On top of that, Ghostwriter Chat now uses different presets to identify and fulfill a request.

## Kaboom 3000

[Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) is a JavaScript game programming library made by Replit focused on ease of use.  Just recently, we released [version 3000](https://kaboomjs.com/blog/3000), which features improved performance, pathfinding, improved physics, and more.

All new Kaboom.js Repls are now set to use version 3000 by default, providing you with the latest and greatest features.

## Notification Panel Polish

The Notifications panel has undergone some slight design changes and now allows you to read and manage your notifications without a hassle.
