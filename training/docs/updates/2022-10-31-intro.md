> This is the first edition of Replit Updates - where we get to share what we‚Äôve been up to in the past week! What have we built for you? What have we fixed for you? It‚Äôs all here. Read to the end for a peek behind the Repls and into the lives of the engineers building Replit!

This week we merged 496 pull requests, pushed 1224 commits, and added 349,343 lines of code to our codebases. See what we shipped: üëá

## What we shipped

### Ghostwriter launch

Earlier today we launched [Ghostwriter](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter) to the public after months of closed beta-testing, and last week the team shipped some final pre-launch improvements to make Ghostwriter faster and more reliable.

  style={{ width: "100% !important" }}

</a>

This was a _major_ team effort:

- [Alex](https://replit.com/@alex-jungle-cat) and [Giuseppe](https://replit.com/@giuseppeatreplit) built Complete Code,
- [Jonathan](https://replit.com/@jnnnthnn-at-replit) and [Krish](https://replit.com/@krishatreplit) built Generate Code and Transform Code,
- Jonathan and [Arnav](https://replit.com/@ArnavBansal) built Explain Code, and
- [Muhammad](https://replit.com/@msareini) and [Samip](https://replit.com/@samipdahal) worked on the AI model backing Complete Code.

When we launch a new product line like Ghostwriter, it takes more than just engineers building the feature itself: Jonathan, [Ted](https://replit.com/@replitted), [Devin](https://replit.com/@theflowingsky), and [Aman](https://replit.com/@amanm3) built out the onboarding experience and purchase flow you‚Äôll go through as you [try the 14-day free trial](https://replit.com/site/ghostwriter).

### Mobile app magic

It‚Äôs been two weeks since we launched our amazing [mobile app](https://replit.com/mobile) for both Android and iOS and we‚Äôve been shipping improvements based on all your wonderful feedback!
Last week:

- [Abdel](https://replit.com/@abdelWithReplit) and [Matthew](https://replit.com/@MCChen) lowered the sensitivity of the `shake to provide feedback` feature and gave active users the ability to turn off the `shake` feature entirely.
- [Ian](https://replit.com/@inkRepl) fixed your mobile keyboard: it no longer covers up the editor or console.
- Matthew also improved TypeScript and JavaScript code suggestions.
- And the _entire team_, led by the incredible [Laima Tazmin](https://replit.com/@replitlaima), made improvements to both stability and speed.

We're always shipping new features and fixes, so be sure to update your app!

### New File History Viewer

This week we moved the entry point for our new History feature from the nav header to the bottom of each file. [Brian](https://replit.com/@brianpool), [Tyler](https://replit.com/@tyler), and [Moudy](https://replit.com/@moudy) collaborated on this redesign, making an already helpful feature dramatically more convenient to access by file.

**You used to find History here - and pressing the button took you to an entirely different page:**

**Now you can find the History icon in the lower-right-hand corner of the tab you're working in. And you can use it without leaving the editor:**

### Bradley made all the things faster

You may have noticed something this week: Replit is faster.

Like, _a lot_ faster.

You can thank [Bradley](https://replit.com/@bheilbrun). Bradley, as one does, discovered a way to cut our web tail latencies _in half_. Overnight our 95th percentile latency dropped from 1+s to less than 500ms. Check out this absolutely bonkers chart:

<img

  alt="Brad made all the slow things go fast"
/>

**The top line represents the slowest 5% of requests to Replit.com Before Bradley (BB). The bottom line is the slowest 5% _After_ Bradley (AB).** Bradley is our hero.

We salute you, Bradley.

### Become a teacher on Replit

If you‚Äôve done any of the 100 Days of Code lessons, you‚Äôve seen the special internal feature we built that lets us [design interactive tutorials directly on Replit](https://building-templates.davidatreplit.repl.co/). We thought it was too good a feature to keep to ourselves, so now _you_ can create your own Replit-native tutorials. [There‚Äôs even a contest with prizes:](https://tutorial-jam.replit-community.repl.co/)

## What we polished

- [Eddie Nuno](https://replit.com/@eddieatreplit) modified the repl auth token expiration time for better user-experience.
- [Toby Ho](https://replit.com/@tobyho) improved the publishing flow to ensure templates are built before they‚Äôre published, which makes them faster for every person who uses them - no more installing packages every run!
- [Madison](https://replit.com/@MadisonFitch) made every teacher‚Äôs week when she shipped an improved/more performant Project Overview page. This new version stays speedy even under peak load!
- We‚Äôve also made our updated brand kit available here: http://replit.com/brandkit . **Please Meme Responsibly‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.**

## Behind the Repls

We love building Replit, and we work really hard. But we have fun too. Every week at the end of the update, we‚Äôre going to share a little peek into some of the _other_ things we‚Äôve gotten up to.

### Comic Sans-sanity

A few weeks ago [Talor](https://replit.com/@TalorAnderson) and [Jonathan](https://replit.com/@jnnnthnn-at-replit) made a deranged bet. _The first bet we‚Äôre aware of, by the way, made in [Cycles](https://replit.com/cycles):_

**The challenge: who can code in Comic Sans the longest?**
Yes, we agree: this is madness. Just look:

<img
  src="https://docimg.replit.com/images/updates/2022-10-31/talorscreen.png"
  alt="Comic Sans all the things"
/>

And, yes, this bet extends to writing code on Replit:

<img
  src="https://docimg.replit.com/images/updates/2022-10-31/replitsans.png"
  alt="Comic Sans is taking over the world!"
/>

> _Editor's note: They‚Äôre both 100% committed to winning, so it‚Äôs likely that many of the new features we ship over the next year will have been written in (shudder) Comic Sans. We would not inflict this on anyone, so please keep Talor and Jonathan in your thoughts._

Keep track of this unhinged experiment on [this Repl](https://comic-sans.taloranderson.repl.co/):

### Debate over the best mechanical keyboard switches rages on

We talk about the important things too: like which mechanical keyboard switches are best. [Gian](https://replit.com/@gian) thinks MX Browns are little too heavy. [Luis](https://replit.com/@luisreplit) thinks Gian might want to tune them, but Giuseppe insists ‚ÄúKailh Box Whites are the pinnacle of switches‚Äù and the conversation eventually devolved into us laughing at reflections of ourselves in [this YouTube parody](https://youtu.be/uHt01D6rOLI).
