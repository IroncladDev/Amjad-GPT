Welcome back to another edition of the Replit Changelog!

In the past three weeks, we merged a total of 914 Pull Requests.

## Faster Deployments

For larger applications, large packages were causing the build phase to take a long time, leading some deployments to time out.

We shipped a change that reduced the deployment time for larger applications by a few minutes.

We also added a nice touch of design to the deployment process ðŸŽ¨

## Secrets Configuration

Digging through existing code to find out how to set the correct environment variables is a time-consuming process, especially for building full stack apps.

After forking a Repl, the key names of existing Environment Variables will now be set in Replit Secrets.

## Search and Replace

Navigating large projects requires fast and responsive search. Using ripgrep and crosis, we built the functionality to search your Repls. We then used a variety of streaming techniques to make it fast.

## Icons in Account Options

When you click on your username in the Sidebar, you will see a list of options leading to different parts of the site. We recently added some icons for a more intuitive design.

## Extension Logs

We added a new section to the Developer Tools pane for Extensions developers. Debugging is now a lot easier during the development process.

## Discord Usernames

With Discord's recent [migration to adopt usernames](https://discord.com/blog/usernames), four-number discriminators are slowly being removed from usernames. We now support this format as a profile customization option.
