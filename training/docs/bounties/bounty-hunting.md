# Bounty Hunting

If you're looking for a way to build projects and earn Cycles while you do it, you're going to love Bounties.

## Become a Bounty Hunter

If you'd like to become a verified Bounty Hunter, [apply here](https://replit.typeform.com/to/ss7IxmIf).
Fill out the form and you'll be notified when you've received the Verified Bounty Hunter badge on your applications.

Otherwise, get started by browsing the [Bounties page](https://replit.com/bounties) and apply to earn Cycles.

## Browse Bounties

Each posted Bounty will include the reward (in Cycles) for successful completion and a description of the work they'd like done.

## Apply to work on a Bounty

Once you find a Bounty you'd like to work on, click the "Apply to Work" button in the upper-right-hand corner.

### Tips for Applying

The best Bounty applications tell the Poster why you are well-suited to complete the Bounty and include examples of relevant past work.

Here are some other tips on how to create a quality application:

- Add links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other social profiles to your Replit account. These links will appear in your Bounty applications as well.
- Make your Replit profile picture a real, professional headshot of yourself.
- If you want to start your Bounty with a greeting, open with "Hello { their username }..." or "Hello, my name is { your first name }..."
- Add links to relevant projects in your application (e.g. Repl, GitHub repo, or hosted project).
- Describe the first 1-2 milestones you will accomplish once accepted. This communicates to the Bounty Poster that you understand their problem and the technical requirements.
- If possible, include time estimates of when certain parts of the Bounty can be completed by after you are accepted.

Here's an example application for a Bounty to create a space invaders game:

> Hi, I'm Matt! I'm an experienced full-stack developer with experience building physics and canvas based games. I can make the cool space invaders game you described in one week.
>
> A few examples of my work include this very solar system animation https://replit.com/@matt/solar?v=1 which I made for fun, a Chrome Dinosaur Game clone https://replit.com/@matt/dino?v=1, and a Flappy Bird clone https://replit.com/matt/flappy?v=1. I would combine my knowledge of space animations and real time games to build your game. As a demonstration of my abilities, I made a basic prototype implementing a spaceship with space-like movement and a very simple particle trail which you can see here https://replit.com/@matt/prototype?v=1
>
> I look forward to hopefully working with you!

## Do the work

If the Bounty Poster selects your application, you'll see the "Accepted" badge on your application:

![time to do the work!](https://docimg.replit.com/images/bounties/accepted.png)

Now it's time to do the work!

Communicate with the Bounty Poster early and often - make sure you're both clear on requirements and expectations.

## Deliver the work

When you've completed your work, return to the Bounty page and click "Submit Work."

Add a description of the work (pro-tip: relate it to the acceptance criteria outlined in the Bounty) and link to the Repl where you've written the code.

![submit a solution](https://docimg.replit.com/images/bounties/submit_solution.png)

The Poster will review your work and may ask for changes.
If the changes are in the scope of the original Bounty, simply go back to the Repl, make the changes, and submit again.

Once the Poster accepts your work, you're awarded your Cycles.
