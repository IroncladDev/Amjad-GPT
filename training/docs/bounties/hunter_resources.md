✅ Use [this template](https://replit.com/@templates/Portfolio-Site-Template?v=1) to create a portfolio of work to pin to your profile.

✅ Add links to previous work, Github profile, Discord, etc. in your profile that are relevant and up to date.

✅ Make sure the repls on your profile are a good representation of your skills.

❌ Don't include partial pieces of work on your profile page (hide those in a folder, or use Private Repls).

❌ The Replit-generated names like PuzzlingPriceyKey are cool and all, but make sure the Repls on your profile have sensible names and are published with nice cover photos.
