# Create your first Replit Extension

#### Learn the basics of extension development by building and previewing a simple extension.

In this guide, you'll build a sample "Hello, world!" React.js extension with a custom Tool UI.

---

## Before you begin

- Make sure you have a Replit account — you'll need to be logged in to create an extension.
- You'll also need to make sure you've verified your email address, as this is required to publish an extension.
- You'll need to be familiar with Javascript, and ideally React.js, which is our preferred framework for building UI Extensions.

## Create an Extension Repl

To start building a Replit extension, you need to create an Extension Repl. This is a special Repl that contains all the configuration necessary to build, preview, and release your extension.

1. <span>

   Fork an [Extension Template](/extensions/basics/templates/). Give it a name
   and click "Create Extension Repl"

    </span>

   />

2. <span>

   After creating the Repl, your Workspace should open. On the left side
   you'll find a code editor, and on the right side, you'll find the Extension
   Devtools tab. [Learn more about devtools
   →](/extensions/development/devtools)

   </span>

## Preview your extension

Building an extension is a lot easier when you can see what you're building. We've made it easy to preview your extension in a Repl, similar to the Webview you're familiar with in other Repls.

_Note: Extension Repls do not support the regular webview. Read more in the [FAQ →](/extensions/faq)_

  type="video/mp4"
></video>

1. **Open Extension Devtools**
2. **Click "Load Locally"**  
   This will run your Repl's development server, if it's not already running, and load your extension in the preview window.
3. **Open a development preview tab**  
   Click the "Preview" button next to any Tool or File Handler in the Extension Devtools to open a preview tab. This will open a new tab in your Workspace, where you can see your extension in action.

## Add features

Next, it's time to start adding features using the Replit Extensions API.

There are two ways to use the APIs, depending on which template you chose:

- **React Extensions**  
  In React Extensions, some APIs have [hooks](/extensions/category/hooks), while others are available on the `replit` object returned by [`useReplit()`](extensions/development/react/hooks/useReplit).
- **Javascript Extensions**  
   In Javascript Extensions, all APIs are available on the global `replit` object created by the [`init` API](/extensions/api/init)

Features are added through the Devtools UI, which is available in the [Extension Devtools](/extensions/development/devtools) tab. Features are divided into three categories:

1. **Tools (_UI Extensions_)**  
   An custom user interface presented as a Tab in the workspace. Examples include a ReplDB editor or a Chat Extension. Learn how to [build your first tool](/extensions/examples/snippet-manager).
2. **File Handlers (_File Editors and Icons_)**  
   File handlers allow you to build Tools and add icons for specific file types. Examples include a JSON file editor or a CSV file editor. Learn how to [build your first file handler](/extensions/examples/json-editor). Under the hood, file handlers are just tools with a filetype association.

### Using devtools to scaffold features

Extension developer tools make it easy to scaffold out new functionality without manually editing the Manifest file. (_Behind the scenes, all the edits you make here are reflected in the Manifest file._)
