# CLUI, the Graphical CLI

Command Line User Interface, often referred to as the CLUI is an interactive command bar from which you can perform a variety of actions. There are three variations of the CLUI located across Replit: Account, Shortcuts, and Workspace.

## Account

The Account CLUI allows you to view and manage your account & teams, view warnings you've been issued, restore deleted Repls, and more. Get started by navigating to the [CLUI page](https://replit.com/~/cli). Type in the input to search for a command, and hit Enter to execute it.
