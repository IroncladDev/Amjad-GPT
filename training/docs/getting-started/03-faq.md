## Repls

### How do I restore a deleted Repl?

Use the CLUI (command line user interface, [blog](https://blog.replit.com/commandbar)) to access the trash:

1. Go to https://replit.com/~/cli.
2. Once you get to the terminal, type "Trash".
3. Choose the "View" option to see your most recently deleted repls.
4. Go back to "Trash" again and choose "Restore" this time, along with the title of the project you want to restore.

### What happens to my Private Repls if I stop using Cycles or run out of Cycles?

Your Repls will remain private but you will not be able to edit the code unless you make the Repl public or subscribe to private Repls again with Cycles.

### Why does my Always On Repl restart sometimes?

Always On Repls are hosted on shared infrastructure. We move Repls around to different servers to make sure that everyone has a good experience. This means that your Repl will restart every once in a while. If you need a dedicated server, you can look into our dedicated server options for [deployments](/hosting/deployments/about-deployments).

## How do I restore a file in my Repl?

Check out our docs on the [History tool](/programming-ide/workspace-features/file-history) to learn how you can restore a file.

### Why is my Repl failing to load?

If your Repl is failing to load, try these debugging steps:

1. Test your [internet connection](https://www.speedtest.net/).
2. Try a different browser.
3. Check if your browser has enabled JavaScript.
4. Use the command `kill 1` in the shell—this will kill and restart the virtual Linux machine backing your Repl.

If none of the above steps helped, check Replit's [Service Status](https://status.replit.com), if "all systems are a go," and you still have issues loading your Repl, please contact [Replit Support](https://replit.com/support).

### How do I change my username?

Replit users can change their username only **once**.  Navigate to the [CLUI](https://replit.com/~/cli/account/change-username?run=1) and change your username. If the option is not available to you, this means you've already changed it.

### What is explorer mode / how can I activate it?

Explorers are a segment of Replit Users who have opted into seeing and testing out new features that are still in development.  To enable explorer mode, navigate to the [Account Page](https://replit.com/account#roles) and toggle the switch on.
