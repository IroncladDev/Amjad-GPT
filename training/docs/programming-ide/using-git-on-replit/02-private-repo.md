Let's start by creating a new Repl from scratch and opening the **Version Control** tab.

The next step is to click the **Existing Git Repo** button. You should get a popup asking to access your GitHub repositories. Simply authorize GitHub by clicking the link "Connect GitHub to import your private repos".

The final step is to install Replit on your personal GitHub account. Allow access to all repositories and hit **Install & Authorize**.

After you've finished this step, the popup should update and allow you to import all of your GitHub repositories! Choose one and hit **Pull changes**.

Your repository's code should now be successfully imported. Let's learn about how to [use the GUI](use-gui) in the next tutorial!
