# Git workflows and commands

The most crucial features of Git to learn are the basic Git workflow and
commands, such as cloning a repository, creating and switching between branches,
committing changes, and pushing and pulling from a remote repository. Understanding
these basic concepts and commands will enable you to use Git effectivelv for your Replit
projects.

Here's a guide of common Git workflows and example commands for them:

## Cloning a repository

This creates a local copy of a remote Git repository.

Example command: `git clone <repository url>`

## Creating and switching between branches

This allows you to work on multiple versions of a project.

Example commands: `git branch branch name>` and `git checkout <branch name>`

## Committing changes

This saves your progress on a project.

Example command: `git commit -m â€¹commit message>`

## Pushing and pulling from a remote repository

This synchronizes your local repository with the remote repository.

Example commands: `git push` and `git pull`.

## Branching and merging

This allows you to create separate branches of a project and merge your changes back into the main branch.

Example commands: `git branch <new branch name>` and `git merge <branch to merge>`

## Resolving merge conflicts

This is the process of resolving conflicts that can arise when multiple users make changes to the same file in a repository.

Example commands: `git merge --abort` and `git merge --continue`
