# Expandable Storage

Expandable Storage provides you with account-wide storage, where your Repls can take up as much space as you have on your account. This is great for storing large amounts of data.

## Viewing Your Storage Usage

To monitor your storage usage, visit the "Resource Usage" section on your account page at https://replit.com/account. You'll see your current storage limit and the amount you've used.

## Storage Limitations Based On Plan

Your storage limits are determined by your chosen subscription plan:

- **Free:** 10GiB
- **Replit Core:** 50GiB

Visit our [pricing page](https://replit.com/pricing) to learn about each plan's features.

  Previous 1GiB storage limitation is no longer enforced.

  <details>
    Storage limits are now account-wide. Each Repl can use any amount of your available account storage without the previous 1GiB restriction.

## What If I Go Over My Storage Limit?

When your combined storage from your Repls exceeds your account storage limit, you will see a warning in the workspace and on the account page, prompting you to delete extra files or Repls or upgrade your plan. You can upgrade your plan in two ways:

1. **From the Workspace:** Click the "Upgrade Storage" button in the warning at the bottom left of the workspace

2. **From the Account Page:** Go to the [Replit Account page](https://replit.com/account) and click the "Upgrade Plan" button in the "Resource Usage" section.

Upgrading your plan increases your account-wide storage limit, providing more storage for your Repls.

## Managing Storage

If you've reached your storage limit, consider upgrading your plan as described above, or free up space by deleting files from your Repls or removing individual Repls.

## Scratch Disk
Every Repl also has a separate filesystem attached to it called the Scratch Disk. Scratch Disk storage is temporary storage used for package installation or to store temporary files. It is reset regularly. 
 
Every Repl has a base Scratch Disk quota of 2 GiB, though using space beyond that will consume account storage while you're using the Repl.
