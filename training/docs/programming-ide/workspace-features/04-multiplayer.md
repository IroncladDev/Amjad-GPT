# Multiplayer

Multiplayer in Replit allows two or more users to code together in real-time.

## Invite someone to Multiplayer

Hit the **Invite** button in the top-right corner of the Workspace, and add someone by their username or email. Alternatively, you can generate an join link and send it to the person you want to invite.

## Observation Mode

Observation mode enables you to view what someone else in your Repl is doing and follows them around as they code and switch to different files.

## Threads & Chat

[Inline Threads](/programming-ide/workspace-features/inline-threads) and Chat allow you to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously with others in Multiplayer.

To start talking with collaborators in your Repl, open the Chat pane from the Tools section of the sidebar.

Threads provide you with the ability to make comments and discuss topics directly in the code.

For more information on how threads work and how to use them to their full extent, check out the corresponding [documentation](/programming-ide/workspace-features/inline-threads).

## Team Repls

Team Repls are multiplayer by default, meaning that all members of a team can access it.
