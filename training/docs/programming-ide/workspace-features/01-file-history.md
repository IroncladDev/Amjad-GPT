# File History

To make sure you never lose any of your work, Replit auto-saves your code as you write. If you ever lose an edit to your code that you'd like to recover, rewind back in time with File History.

Get started by opening a text file in the Workspace and pressing the **History** button in the bottom-right corner.

## Viewing previous versions of a file

Once you've opened up File History, you can view previous versions of a file by using the scroll bar, the arrow buttons, or the **left** and **right** arrow keys.

## Comparing previous versions to the current file

Press the Compare Latest toggle in the bottom left hand of the File History pane to see in-line comparisons of your file at that point in time and the latest version.

## Restoring a previous version of a file

If you want to restore a file to a previous version, just press the `Restore` button, which will restore. Don't worry, you won't erase any history. When you restore to a previous version, it is added as a new version to the file's history.

## Viewing File History playback

You can use the playback feature of File History to watch your file change over time like a movie. This can be useful for creating videos of your programming sessions.
