# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to save time and increase productivity.

The shortcuts shown in this document are the default ones set up in Replit.  See [here](/programming-ide/workspace-features/preferences#keyboard-shortcuts) for customizing keyboard shortcuts.

If you're using a Mac, use the `Cmd` key instead of the `Ctrl` key, and the `Option` key instead of the `Alt` key.  The shortcuts shown in this document do not apply if you have customized your own shortcuts.

## Frequently used keyboard shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts can be used in a variety of ways. If you forget a keyboard shortcut, check the command palette.

### Command palette

The command palette allows you to view all available commands based on your current context.

To access the command palette, press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`.

**Note:** If you are using Firefox, `Ctrl+Shift+P` will open an incognito window, so use the `F1` option instead.

### Navigating with `Tab` key

In most cases, you can navigate the entire page via the `Tab` key. In the editor, console, and shell, however, `Tab` will be used for indentation. In these cases, you can press `Esc` and then press `Tab` to navigate to the next element on the page.
