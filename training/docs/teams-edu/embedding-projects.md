# Embedding projects

To embed a project, follow the simple steps below or follow along with our [video walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/788fb7ade7154c83baf0df6ecf1fe102):

_Please note that to access their project in an iframe, students must be added to the team and logged into their Replit account._

1. Click on the three dot menu found on the right side of each project.
2. Copy the embed code. This will provide you with an [iframe](/teams-edu/embedding-projects) which you can paste into HTML or copy the project link.
3. Paste it wherever you are trying to embed the project, and you'll be good to go!

The embed code you copy will look like the example below:

```
<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://replit.com/team/{team name}/{project name}"></iframe>
```
