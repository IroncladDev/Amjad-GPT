# Lesson Authoring

_You can find a step-by-step guide to creating a new lesson [here](/teams-edu/lesson-authoring-tutorial)._

Teachers may create read-only instructions for their students to follow as well as admin-only lesson plans to keep as notes and share curriculum with their peers using the Curriculum Authoring tool in their Team Project file tree.

To add Lesson Plan and Instructions files to your project, click on "Add Lesson Contents" as shown below:

The lesson contents are automatically created as shown below. Instructions and Lesson Plan files are written in markdown. You can find a handy guide to markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!

To preview the lesson from a student's point of view, as an admin you can add a new non-admin member to your team for testing purposes. You can log in as the member in a different browser to keep the ‘teacher’ (admin) and ‘student’ (non-admin) separate and logged in at the same time.

## Lesson Plans

Lesson Plans are accessible only to admins in the `lessonplan.md` file. They are meant to provide speaker notes for individual teachers or guidance for teachers who may share curriculum with their peers or in the Curriculum Hub.

_Do not place project solutions in the Lesson Plan._
