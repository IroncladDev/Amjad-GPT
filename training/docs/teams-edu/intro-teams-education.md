# Introduction to Teams for Education

[Teams for Education](https://replit.com/teams-for-education) adds key workflows for students and teachers on top of all the core Replit features. In this article, you'll:

- Learn how to sign up for a team

- Get started with extra curriculum and teacher resources.

## More About Teams

A team is a collaborative workspace for teachers and students. The platform is based around projects, which give students real-world experience. Each project can have multiple versions (often, one for each student or group), so students can all start from the same point, but extend the base project in different ways.
