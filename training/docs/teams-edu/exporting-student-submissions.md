# Exporting student submissions

Students may export their project submissions into their personal Replit accounts to maintain access when they are removed from a Team or a Team is archived.

To export their projects from a team, students can go to `https://replit.com/teams/TEAM-USERNAME/export`.

For example, if the team username is @teamsEduDemo, then the link would direct students to log into their accounts, then go to: `https://replit.com/teams/teamsEduDemo/export`
