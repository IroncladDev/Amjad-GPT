# FAQ

#### How do I get started with Teams for Education?

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJjDFJbUzdM) is an introduction tutorial on Teams for Education.

#### How do I manage team members in a team?

You can [invite teachers and students](/teams-edu/inviting-teachers-students) to a team. Additionally, you can [change user roles](/teams-edu/assigning-user-roles) for teachers in order for them to have admin access to the subscription to create their own teams, create projects, etc.

#### How do I create a team project?

[Team Projects](/teams-edu/creating-projects-assignments) are projects and assignments that teachers can set up with starter code, instructions, and materials for their students. When starting a Team Project, students duplicate their own, private versions of the Team Projects to edit and customize freely.

#### How do I auto-grade projects?

One option is [input/output testing](/teams-edu/input-output-testing) which allows a teacher to create simple tests that automatically match input values to expected output in student projects. Teachers can also create [unit tests](/teams-edu/unit-testing) which allows a Repl author to create code-driven tests that compare actual function output with expected output.

#### How do I know if Replit is compliant with my school's compliancy standards?

Replit Teams for Education is COPPA, FERPA, and CIPA compliant. You can learn more about privacy in our [privacy FAQs.](/teams-edu/privacy-faq)

#### I am having trouble with portions of Replit being blocked by my school's servers. What do I do?

Share our [IT Administrators Tooolkit](/teams-edu/it-administrators-toolkit) with your IT department to ensure Replit runs smoothly for your team.

_Addtionally, if your school previously blocked `repl.co` to filter all internet content, you can now unblock it and use [Firewalled Replit](/getting-started/firewalled-replit) for that instead._

#### How do I reset a student's password if their account is a privacy account?

If a student lost or forgot their password, go to their team, open the "Manage team members" window, then find the students account name and click the lock icon to the right of their name.

#### How do I move Repls from the My Repls page to a Team Project?

Forking Repls from the My Repls page is recomended because the Repls on the My Repls page are public, even if you are a teacher, only the Project Repls in a Team are private.

The best practice is to start projects in a Team where they will be private until you publish them. This will prevent students from seeing answers to future Projects.

To fork, or transfer, the Repls in My Repls, use the [CLUI](/getting-started/clui-graphical-cli) tool fork-repl-to-project. See the CLUI link, or view this video here:
