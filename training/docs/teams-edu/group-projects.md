# Individual, Group, and Self-Grouping Projects

_View a video explainer on Group Assignments [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwbgtaDu6EY)._

**For individual projects**, students are able to fork the project and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and team admins can see and edit their work.

**For group projects**, you can assign students into submission groups to collaborate. Click "Auto Assign" to automatically assign all students into equal groups or assign each group manually. You can add and remove new groups, drag and drop students between groups, and search for students. Groups cannot be removed after saving, but students may be reassigned into different groups later.

**Self-Grouping Projects** allow students to create and join their own groups.

Here's what your students will see when a project allows for self-grouping:

If no groups are created, they'll have the option to create their own:

If groups have already been created, they may either join one or create their own:
