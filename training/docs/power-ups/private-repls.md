# Private Repls

With a free Replit account, personal Repls are public by default.

As an individual, you can make your Repls private by subscribing to our [Replit Core membership](https://replit.com/pricing) (previously Hacker or Pro) that comes with unlimited private Repls.

Teams Pro accounts come with the ability to make any Team Repl private.

Private Repls can only be accessed by directly invited guests or by team members.

## Creating a private Repl

You can make a Repl private by toggling the Repl to Private when you're making a new Repl from a Template or forking an existing Repl.
