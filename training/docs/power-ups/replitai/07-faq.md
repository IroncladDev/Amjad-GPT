# FAQ

## General

### What is Replit AI?

Replit AI is Replit’s suite of artificial intelligence features: Complete Code, Generate Code, Edit Code, Explain Code and Chat. Together, they enhance your development experience on Replit.

### How does Replit AI work?

Replit AI returns results generated from large language models trained on publicly available code and tuned by Replit. To make suggestions and explain your code, Replit AI considers what you type and other context from your Repl like the programming language you're using.

### How much does Replit AI cost?

Replit AI is free for all users.

Advanced Replit AI features are available through our Replit Core membership.

You can find more pricing details on our [pricing page](https://replit.com/pricing).

### Which programming languages does Replit AI support?

Replit AI performs best with JavaScript and Python code, but it supports 16 languages in total. The current list:

- Bash

- C#
- C++
- CSS
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML

Note: effectiveness may vary by language.

### Can I turn off Replit AI Complete Code?

Yes. You can turn off Replit AI Complete Code in the Replit workspace. See step-by-step guide [here](/power-ups/replitai/complete-code).


### What is the difference between Generate and Complete Code?

Complete Code actively provides suggestions in your workspace while you program in Replit. In contrast, for Generate Code, you select then prompt the feature with words describing the code you would like.

The two features use different models. For more information on how each works, visit the [Complete Code](/power-ups/replitai/complete-code) docs.

### How can I help?

Use Replit AI and share your feedback with Replit as you code. We also encourage you to report bugs, offensive output, code vulnerabilities, or unwanted data to our Support team at [replit.com/support](https://replit.com/support). Replit works and ships fast, takes trust and safety seriously, and we are committed to continually improving our products.

### Can Replit AI be used on other platforms?

Replit AI is exclusive to Replit.

## Privacy

### Is code I write on Replit shared through Replit AI?

Public Repls (including their code and your keystrokes) may be used to train Replit AI. If you do not wish your Repl to be used for training at all, you may make it private.
    
### Does Replit AI change my rights for code I write on Replit? 

No. As was the case before Replit launched Replit AI, code in public Repls is automatically subject to the MIT License. Check out [Licensing Information](/legal-and-security-info/licensing-info) for details. To check if a given Repl of yours is public or private, go to [My Repls](https://replit.com/repls).

### What data is collected when I use Replit?

To work as an online development environment, Replit collects your interactions with the service and data that you input so we can display and run your software. Like any online service, we use this data so that we can provide and improve our services.

### How can I report problems with code generated or suggested for me?

Code generated or suggested for you may be offensive or otherwise inappropriate. By reporting this, you can help us to improve our products. Click the “Share feedback” link at the bottom right of the Generate Code window to provide your feedback, or visit our [Support page](https://support-form.util.repl.co/) to provide your feedback. Please include a copy of the code that you wrote and the code suggestion or explanation that you received.
