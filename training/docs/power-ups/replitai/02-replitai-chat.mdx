## Tips & Tricks
Getting an AI model to generate the correct results can be challenging. Even though Replit AI has context of some files in your repl, you have to think a little deeper about Replit AI's perspective and how it understands human language.

### 1. Make your questions detailed
Write prompts in fully-formed sentences, and include as much detail and context as you can.

If Replit AI is provided with little information, it has a hard time giving you the results you want

Providing lots of information yields much better results.

  <InlineMessage message="```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();
‎
client.on('guildMemberAdd', member => {
...
```" isGhostWriter/>
</ChatContainer>

### 2. Ask follow-up questions
You can chat with Replit AI like a real pair programmer. Try asking follow-up questions by mentioning a previous message.

  <InlineMessage message="```js

  <InlineMessage message="```js
let numbers = [6, 2, 8, 1];
// Sort the array in ascending order
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
‎
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 6, 8]
```" isGhostWriter/>
</ChatContainer>

### 3. Modify Replit AI's Behavior
Telling Replit AI to act like a programmer in a different field could yield better results.

  <InlineMessage message="```html
<html>
‎
  ‎<head>
‎
  ‎  <title>Daddybase - Database hosting</title>
‎
  ‎  ...
```" isGhostWriter/>
</ChatContainer>

### 4. Explain and reference code
Replit AI Chat can be used to explain files in your code.  Replit AI tries to be smart and include files you interact with. In this example, we have a simple rickroll website as our HTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>Never gonna give you up</title>
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <script>location.href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<ChatContainer avatar="https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1662665479969_1173707b428ef17419de4940af146e6a.png">
  <InlineMessage message="What does the \<script\> tag do in my index.html file?" avatar="https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1662665479969_1173707b428ef17419de4940af146e6a.png" username="IroncladDev"/>
  <InlineMessage message="The \<script\> tag in your index.html file is used to define a script, which is a set of instructions that can be executed by a web browser. In this case, the script redirects the browser to the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ URL." isGhostWriter/>
  <InlineMessage message="What is the title in my index.html file?" avatar="https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1662665479969_1173707b428ef17419de4940af146e6a.png" username="IroncladDev"/>
  <InlineMessage message="The title in your index.html file is 'Never gonna give you up'. This is defined between the <title> and </title> tags on line 5." isGhostWriter/>
</ChatContainer>

## Limitations
Some of the limitations of Replit AI Chat include:
 - No internet access of knowledge of recent events
 - Occasionally hallucinates and gets line numbers incorrectly
 - Does not know _everything_ about your Repl
 - Cannot interact with your Repl (create files, etc)
 - Tries to avoid talking about things that are not related to coding.
