# Boosts

If you want to make your Repls more powerful, you can use the Boost Power Up to increase the number of vCPUs and how much RAM your Repl has.

All free Repls come with **0.5 vCPU + 0.5 GiB RAM**.

The [Replit Core membership](https://replit.com/site/pricing) comes with **4 vCPUs + 8GiB RAM** Repls. 

You can also boost any of your Repls up to **32x (16 vCPUs + 16GiB RAM)** with [Cycles](/cycles/about-cycles).

You can Boost your Repl from inside the Workspace. To activate a Boost:

1. Navigate to your Repl
2. Open the Repl resources panel by clicking to the right of your Repl's name
3. Select the pencil icon under Compute
