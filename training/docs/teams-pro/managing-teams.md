# Managing teams

To create a team, click the "Teams" tab in the sidebar. From the Teams dashboard, click "+ Create a team" and follow the steps. You can invite people using their Replit username or their email address, or by sharing a link through the "Generate a team invite link" button (the link does not expire).

If you've already created a team, navigate to the [Teams dashboard](https://replit.com/teams) and then click on your team name. Once inside, click "Manage team members" in the header. From there, you can invite new members to your existing team.

You will only be able to invite as many people as seats you paid for. The ability to invite will be locked once you reach your limit.
