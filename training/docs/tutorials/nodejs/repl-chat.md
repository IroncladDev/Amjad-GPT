# Building a Replit to Replit Chat App Using Node.js

In this tutorial, we'll make a chat app with a difference. Instead of the usual web client to server chat architecture, we'll have a chat app directly running from your repl's console window in Replit.

We'll use Socket.io to implement websockets in our app. We're helped by the fact that the [Socket.io-client code can be run in Node.js](https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-installation/index.html), not only in a browser!

## Overview and Requirements

We'll use the [Replit](https://replit.com) web IDE for developing and running our chat app. We will end up with one Replit project that runs the chat server, and as many client Replit projects as you want to chat between. You'll need a Replit account for this tutorial, so [create an account](https://replit.com/signup) if you haven't already.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Create the chat server using [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io).
- Create a chat client using the [Socket.io-client](https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-installation/index.html).
- Use the [readline module](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) in Node.js to create the user interface to chat from your repl's console window.

## Create a Chat Server

1. Log into [Replit](https://replit.com) and create a new repl.
2. Choose **Node.js** as your language.
3. Name your repl something like "repl-chat-server".

![create new server Replit instance](https://docimg.replit.com/images/tutorials/15-replit-chat/new-server-project.png)

### Add a web framework

We need to start with a web framework that will be able to route incoming requests from chat clients. We'll use [Express](http://expressjs.com), a popular Node.js web framework. In the default `index.js` file, add a reference to expressjs and create a new express app:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

[Replit](https://replit.com) has a super useful package feature which means we don't need to manually install packages. They will be installed automatically when we reference them in the code, as we've done for Express.

### Add a web server

Now that we have a web framework to route our requests, we need to create a web server to listen for requests and handle the HTTP protocol. We will use the built in [node HTTP module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) for this.

Add a reference to HTTP, and create a new server with the express framework we created above:

```javascript
const http = require("http");
const server = http.Server(app);
```

### Extend the server with Socket.io

To make the chat responsive in realtime, we are going to extend our web server with websockets. Websockets are used to create a long-lived connection between clients and servers. This means we don't have the overhead of creating a new connection to the server each time we want to send and receive messages. Talk about efficient!

Add the following code to extend your server to support websockets:

```javascript
const sockets = require("socket.io");
io = sockets(server);
```

### Listen for new connections and messages

Now that we've got all our infrastructure, we can set up how we want to handle new connections and messages. Socket.io has many [events](https://socket.io/docs/v3/emitting-events/) that we can create and listen for. We'll be using the new `connection` event and a custom `message` event. Add the following code to handle new connection events and incoming messages from clients:

```javascript
io.on("connection", function (connection) {
  connection.on("message", function (data) {
    console.log("new message: " + data);
    io.emit("broadcast", data);
  });
});
```

This code handles a new connection event on **line 1**. It grabs this connection, and waits for a new message to be sent by the client on **line 2**.

Once it has a new message, it writes it to the local server console on **line 3**. This is really just for our own debugging and interest. In a production application, perhaps we would save the message logs for later browsing.

**Line 4** is where we send out, or _emit_, the incoming message to all connected clients, so they can see the message.

### Start up and test the server

Finally, we need to start up our chat server to listen for connections. Add this code to start the server:

```javascript
server.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("listening on port 3000");
});
```

To test the server, click the big "Run" button at the top of your repl. You should see it installing packages, output the connection, and finally write _listening on port 3000_.

### Complete server code

The server code is done! Your completed code should look like this:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const http = require("http");
const server = http.Server(app);

const sockets = require("socket.io");
io = sockets(server);

io.on("connection", function (connection) {
  connection.on("message", function (data) {
    console.log("new message: " + data);
    io.emit("broadcast", data);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("listening on 3000");
});
```

## Building the Chat Client

Create a _new_ repl with **Node.js** as the chosen language. Give this repl a name, like "repl-chat-client".

![create new client Replit instance](https://docimg.replit.com/images/tutorials/15-replit-chat/new-client-project.png)

### Add the Socket client and readline modules

Add the [Socket.io-client](https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-installation/index.html) and [readline module](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) to the **index.js** file:

```javascript
const io = require("socket.io-client");
const readline = require("readline");
```

### Create a new connection to the chat server

Add a connection to your chat server repl by adding the line:

```javascript
var socket = io("https://repl-chat-server.<your username>.repl.co");
```

Replace `<your username>` in the line above with your actual Replit username.

### Setup a console interface

Because we are creating this chat app purely in the repl console, we need to be able to read and write messages from the console. To help us do this, we'll use the [readline module](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html). Create the interface by adding this code:

```javascript
const chat_interface = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});
```

The line `input: process.stdin` means that we will be getting user input from the Standard Input, which commonly means the console. Likewise, `output: process.stdout` means we will output messages to the Standard Output, i.e. the console.

### User and message variables

To remember the user's chat handle (username) and the message they want to send, we'll set up two variables. Add this to your code:

```javascript
var chat_handle = "";
var message_to_send = "";
```

### Handle Socket events

We are interested in two main events:

1. When we successfully connect to the chat server.
2. When the server broadcasts messages to us.

Add this code to connect to these events:

```javascript
socket.on("connect", function () {
  get_chat_handle();
  socket.on("broadcast", display_message);
});
```

You'll notice this code calls two methods: `get_chat_handle` and `display_message`. We'll define these next.

### Getting the user chat handle

Once we're successfully connected to the server, we'll want to introduce the user. Add this function to your code:

```javascript
// Gets the user's name, so we can introduce and prepend each message with their name
function get_chat_handle() {
  chat_interface.question(
    `Hello! What's your chat handle? `,
    function (answer) {
      chat_handle = answer;
      socket.emit("message", chat_handle + " has entered the chat");
      chat();
    }
  );
}
```

This uses the interface we set up earlier to ask a question to the user: _"What's your chat handle?"_. When we get the answer, we store it in the variable `chat_handle` that we added earlier. We then send this to the server using `socket.emit("message")`. The server will get the message, and then broadcast it to all the other chat clients.

Finally, we call the `chat()` function, which we will set up next.

### Waiting and sending user messages

Now we'll implement the `chat()` function, which waits for a user's message and sends it to the server. Add this function to your code:

```javascript
// Waits for a new message to send
function chat() {
  chat_interface.question(chat_handle + ": ", function (message) {
    message_to_send = chat_handle + ": " + message;
    socket.emit("message", message_to_send);
    chat();
  });
}
```

This code adds a prompt to the console with the user's `chat_handle`, and waits for them to enter a message. This is done through the `chat_interface.question` method. When they enter a message, we prepend it with the user's chat handle and save it to the variable `message_to_send` that we added earlier. Then we send this combined user chat handle and message to the server using `socket.emit`. Finally, we call our `chat()` function again, to set up a prompt and wait for the next message.

### Showing messages from other users

Our last function writes out messages that we receive from the server. We get these messages in this code we added earlier: `socket.on('broadcast', display_message);`

This code listened for any broadcast message, and then called the function `display_message`. We'll implement this function now.

Add the `display_message` function to your code:

```javascript
// Handles an incoming message, and checks to see that it is not the one we sent.
// Shows it on the console if it is from another user.
function display_message(message) {
  if (message_to_send != message) {
    console.log("\n" + message);
    chat();
  }
}
```

As noted in the comment above the function declaration, this function first compares the incoming message to the last message the user sent, stored in the `message_to_send` variable. If the incoming message matches, the function ignores it and doesn't write it out. It would look pretty weird if a user sent a message, and then had it sent right back to them!

If it doesn't match (i.e it is a message from another user), then we write it to the console with a newline `\n` preceding it. Then we wait for our user to send a reply by calling our `chat()` function again.

### Complete client code

We are done with the chat client code! The completed code should look like this:

```javascript
const io = require("socket.io-client");
const readline = require("readline");

var socket = io("https://repl-chat-server.<your username>.repl.co");

const chat_interface = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

var chat_handle = "";
var message_to_send = "";

socket.on("connect", function () {
  get_chat_handle();
  socket.on("broadcast", display_message);
});

// Gets the user's name, so we can introduce and append each message with their name
function get_chat_handle() {
  chat_interface.question(
    `Hello! What's your chat handle? `,
    function (answer) {
      chat_handle = answer;
      socket.emit("message", chat_handle + " has entered the chat");
      chat();
    }
  );
}

// Waits for a new message to send
function chat() {
  chat_interface.question(chat_handle + ": ", function (message) {
    message_to_send = chat_handle + ": " + message;
    socket.emit("message", message_to_send);
    chat();
  });
}

// Handles an incoming message, and checks to see that it is not the one we sent.
// Shows it on the console if it is from another user.
function display_message(message) {
  if (message_to_send != message) {
    console.log("\n" + message);
    chat();
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `<your username>` in the Socket connection with your actual username on Replit!

### Running the client app

Now you can click the "Run" button at the top of the chat client repl to test the client app. You should see it installing packages, output the connection, and finally ask _Hello! What's your chat handle?_.

This assumes you are still running the chat server we created earlier.

If you type in a message to your client, you should see it logged on the server. The image below shows the repl console of the client on the left, and the repl console of the server on the right.

## Chatting With a Friend

Now that we've built a server and a client, we can chat with a buddy. Get a friend to copy the client code and run it in their own [Replit](https://replit.com) account so that they can chat with you. Alternatively, share a link with them to your chat client repl.

Run the chat server app. Then run your client app, and your friend's client app.

You should see the client apps prompt for your usernames. After you send them, they'll be shown on both clients and in the server logs. Now you can message each other from the repl console! Once you're comfortable that it works with a friend, you can invite others to join, too.

## Make it Your Own

If you followed along, you'll already have your own version of the chat server and chat client repl to extend. If not, start from ours. Fork the chat server or chat client from the repls embedded below.

## Things to Try Next

You can try some interesting things to spice up your chat app.

- Try using different colors on the message outputs – one for the user, and another for their chat friends. There are many modules available for this, one of them being [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors).
- Try logging the server messages to the [Replit database](/hosting/databases/replit-database), so that you can restore previous chats.
