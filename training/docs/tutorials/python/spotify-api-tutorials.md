# Spotify API tutorials

The folks over at [Data Designs](https://www.datadesigns.co.uk/contact) have created some interactive Replit tutorials based around building projects on the Spotify API. You can find them below.

## [Spotify API project 1: Simple online mixtape](https://mixtape-tutorial.datadesigns.repl.co/)

During this hands-on tutorial you'll learn how to use Python to:

- collect data from web-based APIs
- create a data-driven web application

You'll be working with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to complete your own web app, using the [MixTape template](https://mixtape.datadesigns.repl.co/) and [Replit database](/misc/database). Here's a [completed example](https://mixtape-example.datadesigns.repl.co/).

## [Spotify API project 2: Song seeder and analytics web app](https://seeder-tutorial.datadesigns.repl.co/)

This tutorial follows on from the [MixTape tutorial](https://mixtape-tutorial.datadesigns.repl.co/)

- Object-oriented programming (creating classes and methods)
- Processing, aggregating and analysing data using `pandas`
- Data visualisation using `chartify` (a package based on `bokeh`)

Here's an example of the [finished app](https://seeder.datadesigns.repl.co/).
