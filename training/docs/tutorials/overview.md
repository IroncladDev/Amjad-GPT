# Welcome to _Code with Replit_

In this series of tutorials, you'll go from beginner to expert in coding with Replit. While these lessons are designed to be taken in order, they each make sense on their own too, so feel free to jump in wherever looks the most interesting to you.

**Part 1 - beginner tutorials - Replit features**

The first part of the series teaches you to use specific Replit features. You'll learn how to use Replit for everything from solving basic maths problems to building production-grade software, integrating with other tools like GitHub.

**Part 2 - intermediate tutorials - building fun and useful projects**

In the second part of the series, you'll work through a set of projects, including chatbots, games, and more. We are constantly expanding these, so feel free to let us know if there are any topics you want to see included.

### Video introduction

If you prefer video, here's a quick start walkthrough, or read the text tutorials below.

## Part 1: beginner tutorials - Replit features

In this section of the course, you'll learn the basics of Replit. But that doesn't mean you won't build some fun stuff along the way.

#### [Introduction to Replit and using the IDE](/programming-ide/introduction-to-the-workspace)

Learn the basics of the Replit IDE. Why use an online IDE and what are all those different panes? Build a simple program to solve your maths homework.

#### [Managing dependencies with Replit](/programming-ide/installing-packages)

No one is an island, and if you build software you'll build it on top of existing modules that others have written. Here we show you how to work with other people's code in a variety of ways: in many cases all you need to do is [import antigravity and fly away](https://xkcd.com/353/).

#### [Data science: plotting and graphing](/tutorials/python/data-science-and-visualisation-with-repl-it)

Data is only useful if it can be easily understood. Plots, charts, and graphs are the easiest way to know what's happening in the world around you. And did you know that data science is [the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)? Follow along to plot every city in the USA and find out if richer people live longer.

#### [Pair programming and using multiplayer](/programming-ide/workspace-features/multiplayer)

Did we mention that no one is an island? Coders don't have to work alone. You can invite your friends to code along with you, a technique used by beginners and experts alike. Learn how to code collaboratively, as if you were using a Google Doc.

#### [Running projects from GitHub](/category/using-git-on-replit)

Most open-source software lives on GitHub and it's easy to take advantage of all of this free software by pulling code from GitHub to Replit and running it with one click. Some software needs to be configured in specific ways so you'll also learn how to modify what happens when you press that big green "run" button.

#### [Building a game with PyGame](/tutorials/python/building-a-game-with-pygame)

#### [Can you keep a secret? What about from time travellers?](/programming-ide/workspace-features/secrets)

Have you been hacked? It's only a matter of time if you haven't. Learn how to keep your secrets safe, even when coding in public spaces. Pro tip: if you accidentally paste a password into your code and then remove it, others might still find it in your history, so you'll learn how to navigate that too.

#### [Creating a name-splitting application using test driven development](/tutorials/python/test-driven-development)

Build a system to split users' names into first name and last name. We'll follow test-driven-development best-practices along the way so you can be sure your code does what you think it does.
