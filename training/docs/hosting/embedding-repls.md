# Embedding Repls
With embeds, you can easily embed any public Repl you have.  Simply add the `?embed=true` attribute to the end of the Repl's URL. The following example demonstrates how to use an `iframe` to embed a Repl:

```html
<iframe src="<YOUR REPL LINK>" width="600" height="400" />
```

Note: Replace `<YOUR REPL LINK>` with the link to your Repl (e.g. https://replit.com/@user/repl-name)

<iframe src="https://replit.com/@torcado/SSSPICY?embed=1" height="600"/>
